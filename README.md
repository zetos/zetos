### Hello, I'm Zetos 👋

- 🖥️ I'm a Backend Developer.

- 🔭 I work with:
  - NodeJs using Typescript applying FP principles whenever possible.
  - AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS, SQS, etc) for a serverless environment.
  - For more information about stacks and frameworks that i used check my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zetos/).
- 🌱 I’m currently:
  - Learning Haskell.
  - Slowly improving my [dotfiles](https://github.com/zetos/dotfiles).
  - Always doing some small project to test and learn something new.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have lived in a age where NodeJs had TCO under a flag, [Here's a musical made in that era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PX0BV9hGZY&ab_channel=Confreaks).
